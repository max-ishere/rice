# Rice configuration file generator
*v0.0.1*

This python project generates config files using python source. Such configs are easier to change and they allow you to share thee same themes, fonts, etc across multiple files. It does not matter if the theme data is stored in a different format since python can format it for you.

The project is a work in progress and thus dont expect the API to be stable. At this point I am adding various features to make the code easier to manage. Python is not the final implementation language, it may be replaced with a better language down the line. Python is good for prototypes but gives you insane errors/roadblocks sometimes.
